		<p class="summary">An <b>indoor percussion ensemble</b> or indoor drumline consists of the marching percussion (or battery) and front ensemble (or pit) sections of a marching band or drum corps. The only exceptions are in concert divisions (e.g. Percussion Scholastic Concert Open ) where the marching line is absent and the ensemble consists entirely of a pit. 
		Indoor Percussion marries elements of music performance, marching, and theater; thus, the activity is often referred to as percussion theater. Although most indoor percussion ensembles are affiliated with high schools, there are also many independent groups that draw participants from a large area. 
		Independent groups typically start rehearsing in October and groups associated with high schools start after marching band season ends in November or December, and the season culminates with WGI World Championships in April. It is sometimes called Winter Percussion due to the season in which it mostly occurs.</p>

		<h2>History of the activity</h2>
		<p class="history">Indoor percussion (Drumline) began in 1969 at the Dassel-Cokato High School in Cokato, Minnesota, pioneered by the schools band instructor Steve Johnson. Their show "At the Dawn of War" attracted many national as well as international musicians, specifically percussion experts. 
		The athletic arts were looking for a new intriguing sport that could challenge and excite skilled musicians, so they started creating their own styles all over the world. Over the past 30 years, marching percussion has advanced and moved into auditoriums and gymnasiums as percussion ensembles looked for ways to maintain their skills during the winter months when performing outdoors on football fields was not practical. 
		Following in the footsteps of indoor guard ensembles, indoor percussion ensembles arrange music and motion appropriate for a more intimate setting. The activity is enjoyed throughout the United States and Japan, as Winter Guard International (WGI) provides many regional and national opportunities to compete. Percussion ensembles first appeared in WGI shows in 1992, and the theatrics, sets, and music selection has advanced throughout the activity's history. 
		There are many organizations unaffiliated with WGI that hold smaller regional shows.
		<br />
		<p>Competitive groups are held to specific times and judged on criteria that change every season as technology and creativity blossom. These ensembles compete, but traditionally, the musical sport is treated as a place to grow together as a community, learn new techniques, and enjoy the work done by peers from across the country and locally.</p>
		<p>Competition became international when Color Guard Netherlands (CGN) introduced Indoor Percussion in Europe. In 2008 CGN hosted the very first WGI Regional for Percussion outside of North-America.</p>

		<h3>Music</h3>
		<p class="music">Music is arranged based on original works, as well as recreations of movie themes, popular music, classical music, and more. Instrumentation is anything that would or could be used under the percussion category of any musical group, including: snare drums, tenor drums or quads, bass drums, cymbals, xylophones, marimbas, vibraphones, tambourines, chimes, timpani, drum kits, and other similar instruments. 
		Electronic instruments such as guitars, bass guitars, theremins, and synthesizers are also allowed - however, no prerecorded music may be played. Spoken word via microphone or a recording on a sampler is used on occasion as well. Unconventional instruments such as trash cans, barrels, pipes, brooms, and other things that make percussive sounds are sometimes used.</p>
